# UI Clone of [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) website
## Features
In this I just make a Home page of Apple which contains 
- Navbar
- Card 
- Carousel
- Footer etc.

and it shows the product of Apple like Phones, watches, laptop and other electronics accessories and it's services like Tv shows, movies, etc.

## Functionality and Approach
- ## Navbar
In navbar it shows many options regarding their products and services like watches, airpods, ipad and along with this there is a search bar, Bag which helps user to easily navigate according to their needs.

In navbar, there is two `<div>` , first for all the navbutton and second for the search.
when we click on the search icon then, the `<div>` of navbuttons will hide and search div came into a picture.

and I made a two navbar, one for the bigger screen and another for the smaller screen so that page will be responsive.
### Tech Stack used in Navbar: HTML, CSS-flexbox
In Navbar Bag button, we can find lots of stuff like accounts, signin, orders, saved items options which make this website more customized. And all these have very nice Hover Effect.
### Tech Stack used in Navbar Bag button: React Bootstrap/dropdown

And after that there is a few sections regarding their products which gives options to learn more about the product, buy or order now, stream now, apply etc.

And For these sections, I used two images for each. One for the large screen and another for the smaller screen so that our page is responsive.
- ## Carousel
In carousel, it displays current shows or TV series or movies.
I made this carousel using `npm` package called `react-multi-carousel`. I customized this carousel according to my need and size of screen for making it responsive too and attractive as well.
- ## Footer

Footer section gives link of all the content of this site.
and I made a two footer, one for the bigger screen and another for the smaller screen so that page will be responsive.
I made whole footer with a HTML, CSS except one thing called 
accordian which I made using React Bootstrap and then customized it according to the real website of Apple.

- ## Responsiveness

It works in any devices. It is fully responsive.
Navbar, carousel, cards and footer changes it's layout according to the device.
